bower_main.json
Use by `Gruntfile.js` to retrieve and build the included bower components.

Contains of tree entities

exclude:
List of components you want to exclude.
	
dependencies:
Unfortunately not all Bower components list their dependencies. 
If components concatenate in the wrong order, use this option to manually specify dependencies for those components. 
	
mainFiles:
Some Bower components don�t list their main files or (more likely) don�t have bower.json file at all. 
In this case bower-concat will try to guess main file but sometimes it can�t or choose wrong one. 
You could explicitly define main files for that components.
See https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-bower-concat

Example
	{
		"dependencies": {
			"package_name": "jquery",
			"package_name": ["jquery", "another_package_name"]
		},
		"exclude": [
			"package_name_to_exclude",
			"another_package_name_to_exclude"
		],
		"mainFiles": {
			"package_name1": "src/package_name1.min.js",
			"package_name2": ["dist/package_name2.js", "dist/package_name2.css"]
		},
